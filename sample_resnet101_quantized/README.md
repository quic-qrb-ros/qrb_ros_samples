# AI Samples Resnet101 Quantized

## Overview

ResNet101 is a machine learning model that can classify images from the Imagenet dataset. It can also be used as a backbone in building more complex models for specific use cases.

`sample_resnet101 quantized` is a Python-based classify images ROS node that uses QNN for model inference.

## Use cases on QCLINUX

### Prerequisites
- `SSH` is enabled in 'Permissive' mode with the steps mentioned in [Log in using SSH](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70017-254/how_to.html?vproduct=1601111740013072&latest=true#use-ssh).

- Download Robotics image and QIRP SDK from [QC artifacts](https://artifacts.codelinaro.org/ui/native/qli-ci/flashable-binaries/qirpsdk/) or Generate Robotics image and QIRP SDK with [meta-qcom-robotics-sdk/README.md](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom-robotics-sdk)

- The prebuilt robotics image is flashed, see [Flash image](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70017-254/flash_images.html?vproduct=1601111740013072&latest=true)

### On Host
On the host machine, move to the artifacts directory and decompress the package using the `tar` command.

1. Build projects

```bash
#source qirp sdk env
tar -zxf qirp-sdk_<qirp_version>.tar.gz
cd <qirp_decompressed_path>/qirp-sdk
source setup.sh 

#build Samples
cd <qirp_decompressed_path>/qirp-sdk/qirp_samples/ai_vision/sample_resnet101_quantized
colcon build
```

2. Install Packages

```bash
cd <qirp_decompressed_workspace>/qirp-sdk/qirp_samples/ai_vision/sample_resnet101_quantized/
scp -r install/sample_resnet101_quantized/* root@10.92.129.14:/usr
```



### On Device

```bash
(ssh) /usr/share/qirp-setup.sh
(ssh) ros2 launch sample_resnet101_quantized  launch_with_image_publisher.py
 or
(ssh) ros2 launch sample_resnet101_quantized  launch_with_image_publisher.py image_path:=/usr/share/sample_resnet101_quantized/cup.jpg
